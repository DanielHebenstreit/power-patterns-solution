# Power Patterns Solution – TU Graz Student Team

## Overview
This repository contains our solution to the [**Power Patterns Challenge**](https://thinkonward.com/app/c/challenges/power-patterns) organized by ThinkOnward.  
Our team from TU Graz achieved **4th place overall** in this competition.  

The repository includes the Jupyter notebook with our implementation, along with the environment setup instructions.  
**Note:** The original competition data is **not included** and must be obtained separately from ThinkOnward.
